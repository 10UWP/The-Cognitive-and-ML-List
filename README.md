[Computational Network Toolkit (CNTK)](https://github.com/Microsoft/CNTK) CNTK (http://www.cntk.ai/), the Computational Network Toolkit by Microsoft Research, is a unified deep-learning toolkit that describes neural networks as a series of computational steps via a directed graph. In this directed graph, leaf nodes represent input values or network parameters, while other nodes represent matrix operations upon their inputs. CNTK allows to easily realize and combine popular model types such as feed-forward DNNs, convolutional nets (CNNs), and recurrent networks (RNNs/LSTMs). It implements stochastic gradient descent (SGD, error backpropagation) learning with automatic differentiation and parallelization across multiple GPUs and servers. CNTK has been available under an open-source license since April 2015. It is our hope that the community will take advantage of CNTK to share ideas more quickly through the exchange of open source working code.

[Language Understanding Intelligent Service API](https://github.com/Microsoft/Cognitive-LUIS-Windows) Windows (.Net) SDK for the Microsoft Language Understanding Intelligent Service API, part of Congitive Services http://www.microsoft.com/cognitive-services/en-us/language-understanding-intelligent-service-luis - LUIS is a service for language understanding that provides intent classification and entity extraction. In order to use the SDK you first need to create and publish an app on www.luis.ai where you will get your appID and appKey and put their values into App.config in the application provided. The solution contains the SDK itself and a sample application that contains 2 sample use cases (one with intent routers and one using the client directly)

[Mobius](https://github.com/Microsoft/Mobius) C# language binding and extensions to Apache Spark. Mobius provides C# language binding to Apache Spark enabling the implementation of Spark driver program and data processing operations in the languages supported in the .NET framework like C# or F#.

[Cognitive Services Face client library for Android](https://github.com/Microsoft/Cognitive-Face-Android) Cognitive Services Face client library for Android. https://www.microsoft.com/cognitive-services/en-us/face-api - This repo contains the Android client library & sample for the Microsoft Face API, an offering within Microsoft Cognitive Services, formerly known as Project Oxford.
